> [!WARNING]
> Following Microsoft's decision to merge GitHub into its AI division in the summer of 2025 and therefore to consider what we publish on it only as a source of training for its models without any compensation (apart from hosting the source codes) or to bombard us with their injunctions to use Copilot everywhere, for everything and anything, I have decided to stop maintaining the repositories here.
