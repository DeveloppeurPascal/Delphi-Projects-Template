## Compatibility

As an [Embarcadero MVP](https://www.embarcadero.com/resources/partners/mvp-directory), I benefit from the latest versions of [Delphi](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi) and [C++ Builder](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/cbuilder) in [RAD Studio](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/rad-studio) as soon as they are released. I therefore work with these versions.

Normally, my libraries and components should also run on at least the current version of [Delphi Community Edition](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi/starter).

There's no guarantee of compatibility with earlier versions, even though I try to keep my code clean and avoid using too many of the new ways of writing in it (type inference, inline var and multiline strings).

If you detect any anomalies on earlier versions, please don't hesitate to [report them](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/XXXXXXXXXX/issues) so that I can test and try to correct or provide a workaround.
